# M5FlowerPot

M5FlowerPot is a smart plant monitoring system developed in **2023** as part of the **Basics of IoT** course. The project leverages IoT technologies to track environmental conditions of potted plants, ensuring optimal care through real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Project Description
This project integrates sensors and IoT components to measure and display plant conditions. The system collects soil moisture and temperature data, processes it on an M5Stack device, and transmits it to a remote dashboard for visualization and analysis.

## Devices & Components Used
- **M5Stack Core2** - Main processing unit with display
- **Moisture Sensor and Pump** - Measures soil hydration levels and enables automatic watering
- **ENV II Sensor** - Captures environmental data, including temperature and humidity
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity** - Enables remote data transmission

## Software & Tools Used
- **Arduino IDE** - Development and programming of M5Stack
- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** - Message passing between devices
- **Node-RED** - Visual interface for data visualization and automation
